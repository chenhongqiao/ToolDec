<content>I want you to choose a preferred answer in the candidate answers. To do so, I will give you the task description that given to the models, and the candidate answers in a list for chosen. To choose the preferred answer, first analyse each answer with the following rules, then give the index number of the preferred answer by calling `choose_preference`.
Here are the preference rules:
1. if both answers give the none empty `final_answer`, check whether the given `final_answer` can solve the query given.
1.1 if both answers solve the query, choose the one with smaller `total_steps`.
1.1.1 if steps are same, choose one answer with better quality.
1.2 if one answer solve while the other does not, choose the answer that solves it.
1.3 if both answers failed, choose one based on the following preference:
1.3.1 More success tool calling.
1.3.2 Using more various tools.
1.3.3 Shorter steps.
2. if one give none empty `final_answer` while other not, choose the one give `final_answer`.
3. if both `final_answer` are empty, follow rule 1.3 to choose one.
Here is the task description:
{task_description}
Here are the candidate answers:
{answers}
Now choose the preferred answer by analysing results and the rules given, return the index in range [0,1].</content>
