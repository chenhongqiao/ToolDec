His group affiliations include Alpha Flight and his relatives include his wife Diamond Lil.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any famous quotes by Spider-Man or Box IV. \n\nOne interesting math fact unrelated to superheroes is that the number 85 is the product of two prime numbers (5 and 17), making it a biprime.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
