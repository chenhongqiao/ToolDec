Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.qrlink_api: Introducing a powerful and efficient API that transforms URLs  into high-quality QR codes (Quick Response codes). QR codes are advanced 2D barcodes that can be scanned with a smartphone or a QR code reader, enabling quick access to information. Whether you're looking to enhance your marketing efforts or streamline your business processes, our API is the perfect solution for all your QR code needs.\n2.simple_cheap_qr_code_generator: Send a string, get a QR CODE - As simple as it gets\n3.question_explorer: Question Explorer\n4.arabiccountrylist: Country list in Arabic\n"
