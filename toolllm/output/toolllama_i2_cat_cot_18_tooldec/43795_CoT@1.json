Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.dailycred: Identity made simple: everything you need to manage users for your website or app.\r\rDailyCred wraps all of your OAuth providers into a single OAuth call.  You can also use DailyCred to authenticate email and password users as well as Twitter and LinkedIn users using OAuth 2.\r\rDailyCred aggregates all of your user data and combines it with page view information in a single place.
